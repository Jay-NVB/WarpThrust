# WarpThrust

Better PersistentThrust plugin, now with built-in configs for Far Future Technologies and Near Future Propulsion!

Instructions:
- Power your craft with a plugin-compatible engine (it will have a WarpThrust box in the right-click window if it is).
- When in flight, select the desired SAS orientation. DO NOT USE MECHJEB, the plugin will fail to activate.
- Engage on-rails timewarp and watch the magic happen.
